# Todos

This is a to-do list to-do application with the ability to track progress written using React. The application is connected to the server to save the user and the to-do list of a particular user. Binds to localStorage to save the state of the application when the page is reloaded. Also implemented the ability to change the theme of the application (the default browser theme is set).

The web application is adapted for both desktop and touchscreen devices.

## Description

The first step is to authorize or create a new user (you can choose the appropriate form). If you don't want to register a new user - use username newUser.
Next, the user's cases will be loaded and you can interact with the data: change the status of the case, edit its title or delete it. You can create a new case using the corresponding input field. In the footer of the list there is a field that displays the number of unfinished cases, filters for the cases displayed (all, active, completed) and a button to delete all completed cases.
